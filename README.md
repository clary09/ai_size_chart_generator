# AI-Powered Size Chart Generator

## Overview

The AI-Powered Size Chart Generator is a project designed to generate accurate size charts for apparel sellers with limited or inaccurate size data. The system utilizes user body measurements, previous purchase history, and return/exchange data to cluster similar body types and generate comprehensive size charts. The project also includes confidence scores for each measurement and allows for easy updating as new purchase data becomes available.

## Features

- **Data Utilization**: Uses a database of user body measurements (height, weight, chest, waist, hip, etc.) and analyzes users' previous purchase history and return/exchange data.
- **Clustering**: Clusters similar body types and their corresponding successful purchases to create accurate size charts.
- **Size Chart Generation**: Generates a comprehensive size chart for sellers, including measurements for different sizes (S, M, L, XL, etc.).
- **Confidence Scores**: Provides confidence scores for each measurement in the generated size chart.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Allows for easy updating as new purchase data becomes available.
- **Error Handling**: Includes sophisticated error handling to ensure robustness.
- **API Integration**: Integrates with real-world databases and APIs.
